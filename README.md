### SpellCheck

This is an NLP algorithm able correct corrupted files using tokenization and Levenshtein distance between two sequences.

My function used:
* A few paragraphs from the corrupted Jane Austen's book "Sense and Sensibility". (see try.txt)
* A text file containing 10000 most popular English words. (see tenth.txt)
